            <h3>1. Higher ratings on the spinner gets paired with a terrible trait while lower ratings get good traits
                <br><br> 2. Whoever went on a date most recently serves as the first host. The host spins first.
                <br><br> 3. In their head the host picks the new number they would give that partner based on how much
                they value/hate the trait in question.
                <br><br> 4. Once the host is ready, they count down from three. Using their fingers, everyone must then
                say what number they would give the potnetial partner.
                <br><br> 5. Everyone who matches the host gets a point.
                <br><br> 6. Whoever gets ten points first wins!
